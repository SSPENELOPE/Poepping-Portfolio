# Tylers Portfolio

# Description
- This is my most up to date portfolio. It is a work in progress so expect items to be missing or in "coming soon" status. As i continue to progress through school and make more projects I will update my portfolio so it includes all my most recent work.

# Installation 
- No installation required

# Usage
- Use this portfolio at your discretion. Feel free to use the code or just play around with the features and see if you like it.

- Nav links at the top of the page will take you to their respective page sections. I am aware that they do not take you to the very top of that section but I will update and fix that as I continue to hone my skills and learn the tools for that solution. 

- The nav button "Resume" does not have a page section. To view and use my resume simply click on "Resume" and it should download to your machine. My resume is in .docx format so keep in mind depening on if you're using a smart phone that format may not be supported.
