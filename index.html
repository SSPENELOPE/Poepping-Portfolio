            <p class="biography-text">
                I am a 7 year Army Veteran. As part of my service i was stationed in Europe where i got to travel various parts of the continent. During my travels I got to expierence many unique foods, cultures and ways of living which was an educational and amazing expierence.
                I departed the miltary in March of 2022 and proceeded to enroll in the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp in May of 2022. Prior to starting the UofM's Coding Bootcamp I started teaching myself HTML/CSS through Free Coding Camp where i became certified.
                I began school through the UofM's Coding Bootcamp on the 27th of June 2022 with anticipation of graduation and the hopes of having a successful career as a Software/Application Developer. A few personal things about me, I love dogs, video games, and hunting.
